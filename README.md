# Midway Wheels 2 / Taito Speed Race CL-5 remake.
Game Maker 1.4 project.


This is not a simulation, the original game was short and fun, this project tries to have similar gameplay and add elements of two player turn based system for competition. It also allows more than one attempt per player if enabled.

Important notes:
1. Steering uses Mouse X axis, so you need some rotary encoder. This game cannot be at present played using just a keyboard.
2. No resolution switching - 380 x 240 for use in CRT

Issues:
Flicker on CRT
